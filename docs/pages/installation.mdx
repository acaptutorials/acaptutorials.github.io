### Post-Installation

After installing ACAP, additional setup is required, including configuring the web map on the Home Page, updating static PDF content, and replacing the OpenGraph thumbnails.

For detailed instructions on these steps, refer to the [Post-Installation](/post-installation) section after completing the Installation process.

### Repository Syncing Options

If you are working on a forked repository behind several updates from the parent **`acap-v2`** repository, you can get the latest updates or bug fixes using any of the options:

- "Sync" your forked repository's `dev` branch to the parent repository's `dev` branch.
   <Callout type="warning">
   Take care not to "discard" your commits.
   </Callout>
- Create a Pull Request (PR) from the "parent" repository's (**acap-v2**) - **`dev`** branch to your "forked" repository's **`dev`** branch, then merge/resolve conflicts.
- Pick only the target updates/fixes, then commit them to your fork.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Project Maintainers occasionally update the parent repository **acap-v2** for maintenance, bug fixes, and minor/optional updates. _Sometimes, massive new feature updates_.

Of the three (3) repository syncing options mentioned, doing the first or second options ensures up-to-date sync with the latest updates and bug fixes.
</Callout>


<Callout>
All updates and fixes should be from the (parent) **acap-v2** repository's (default) **`dev`** branch. Updates to the **acap-v2** `dev` branch expect to have been tested and ensured compatibility by the main ACAP code Maintainer(s) before committing new updates and fixes to the `dev` branch.
</Callout>


### Questions and Inquiries

- Concerns, questions, and inquiries with ACAP go through the mode of communication channel elected within ACAP (the ACAP FB Group Messenger).
   > This communication channel is reserved only for the current "active" and "official" ACAP members group.
- Alternatively, developers may create tickets (**GitHub Issues**) [within the (parent) **acap-v2** repository](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues) to describe their concerns in more detail. This page also contains code-related information about past inquiries and bug fixes that may be useful to other regions.
   > The main ACAP code Maintainers ("active" and "inactive") may respond to these tickets within their available time.
