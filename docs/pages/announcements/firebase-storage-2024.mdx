# Firebase Storage Pricing Plan Updates (2024)

> _This article is a recap of the online meeting about changes to the Firebase Storage pricing plan held last October 14, 2024._

Firebase announced breaking changes regarding the no-cost pricing plan of their **Firebase Storage** service last September 2024. More information about this announcement is available in the [Cloud Storage Documentation for Firebase](https://firebase.google.cn/docs/storage/faqs-storage-changes-announced-sept-2024).

## FAQs

<FAQBox title="What is the Firebase Storage?">
[Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage), also known as _Firebase Cloud Storage_, is an online cloud storage service provided by Google Firebase. It is one (1) of the four (4) major Firebase components used by ACAP aside from the **Firestore Database** <sup>[[1]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)</sup>, **Firebase Authentication** <sup>[[3]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)</sup>, and **Firebase Hosting** <sup>[[4]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)</sup>.

ACAP uses the Firebase Storage for:

- Hosting and uploading the generated PDF bulletin recommendations, allowing public PDF downloads in its PDF Bulletins Downloads page.
- Hosting and storing several frontend picture assets and files or the Home page's GEOJSON map file (as an alternate option for using MapBox).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Are there other Firebase components used by ACAP?">
ACAP uses other Firebase components aside from the Firebase Storage. ACAP only uses the four (4) Firebase components among Firebase's [list of available](https://firebase.google.com/products-build) components/services:

- **Firestore** (Database) <sup>[[1]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)</sup>
- **Cloud Storage** (Firebase Storage) <sup>[[2]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/)</sup>
- **Authentication** (Email/Password) <sup>[[3]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)</sup>
- **Hosting** <sup>[[4]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)</sup>
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What are the notable changes (s) of this announcement?">
- Starting <u><b>October 30, 2024</b></u>, Firebase will no longer offer the no-cost Spark plan for Firebase Storage.
- More information about this announcement is available at https://firebase.google.cn/docs/storage/faqs-storage-changes-announced-sept-2024.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How will changes to Firebase Storage affect ACAP?">

Starting on <span className="font-bold text-md text-green-600">October 30, 2024</span>:

- Initializing new Firebase Storage instances <u><b>will require a payment method</b></u>. It will require new Firebase projects subscribed to the Firebase pay-as-you-go Blaze plan by default.
- Existing ACAP Firebase Storage on the no-cost Spark plan, <u><b>created before October 30, 2024</b></u>, will continue to work <u><b>until October 2025</b></u>.
- ACAP Firebase Storages not subscribed to the Firebase Blaze plan <u><b>after October 2025</b></u> will <u><b>cease to function</b></u> unless they subscribe to the Blaze plan.
- <u><b>ACAP Video Tutorials</b></u> <sup>[[1]](https://youtu.be/gJESQaT0IBQ?si=fYA19J9OHiZR4V9X&t=127)</sup> regarding the Firebase Storage initialization will not work on Firebase projects subscribed to the standard (no-cost) Firebase plans

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Will the other Firebase components used by ACAP be affected?">
- No, this announcement only affects the <u>Firebase Storage</u>. Discontinued support of the Firebase standard (no-cost) pricing plan only affects the Firebase Storage.
- Other Firebase components used and activated by ACAP - the <u>Firestore Database</u>, <u>Firebase Authentication</u>, and <u>Firebase Hosting</u> still retain their standard (no-cost) pricing plans until further announcements or changes by Google Firebase.

<Callout>
Subscribing to the Firebase Blaze Plan **will automatically enroll** all Firebase components/services to the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan, not just the Firebase Storage.
However, billing chargesÂ beyond the no-cost usage quotas <u>will only incur</u> on <u><b>manually activated</b></u> Firebase services.
</Callout>
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Where can I find the Firebase Pricing Plan?">
The Firebase pricing plan is accessible at https://firebase.google.com/pricing.

<Callout>
Subscribing to the Firebase Blaze Plan **will automatically enroll** all Firebase components to the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan, <u>including other Firebase components not used by ACAP</u>.

ACAP only uses the following Firebase components among Firebase's [list of available](https://firebase.google.com/products-build) components/services:

- **Firestore** (Database) <sup>[[1]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)</sup>
- **Cloud Storage** (Firebase Storage) <sup>[[2]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/)</sup>
- **Authentication** (Email/Password) <sup>[[3]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)</sup>
- **Hosting** <sup>[[4]](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)</sup>

_All Firebase components service usage (including those not used by ACAP) will only reflect in the billing <u><b>upon activation</b></u> in the ACAP and <u><b>usage</b></u> beyond the no-cost Firebase plan._
</Callout>
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What should I know about subscribing to the Firebase Blaze Plan?">

- Subscribing to the Firebase pay-as-you-go Blaze plan requires creating a Google Cloud billing account and electing credit card information for the Firebase project.
- ACAP only expects usage from the **Firestore Database**, **Firebase Storage**, **Authentication**, and **Hosting** Firebase services.
- Billing subscriptions will only incur beyond standard (no-cost) usage/quotas of <u><b>activated</b></u> and <u><b>used</b></u> Firebase components/services <u>enabled by developers</u>.
- If ACAP developers activate Firebase Blaze, <u><b>only the four (4) services mentioned above</b></u> are expected to incur costs unless <u><b>additional Firebase services are manually enabled</b></u>.

   <Callout>
   Refer to the Firebase Pricing table for more information about the standard (no-cost) billing and usage quotas at
   https://firebase.google.com/pricing
   </Callout>

- Firebase usage analytics are accessible at this URL with or without a subscription to the Firebase Blaze plan:

   ```text copy
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT>/usage
   ```

   This page provides information for monitoring and providing insights, such as detailed pricing and usage of the active Firebase services used by the Firebase project.

   <Callout type="warning">
   ACAP expects usage only from the following Firebase services: **Firestore Database**, **Firebase Storage**, **Authentication**, and **Hosting**. [ACAP's Security guidelines](/security) only cover these four (4) Firebase components, aside from general web application security practices and know-how, e.g., stressing the need for data validation <sup>[[1]](/security/#database) [[2]](/directories/server)</sup>.

   > Developers can <u><b>use</b></u> and <u><b>activate</b></u> other Firebase components as deemed necessary when needed. However, since they are not included originally in the ACAP project Firebase components, developers should care about using them responsibly to <u>avoid incurring security issues and unexpected billing</u>.
   </Callout>
</FAQBox>

<div id="security-considerations" />
<FAQBox title="Are there security considerations that I should be aware of?" color="text-red-700 dark:nx-text-red-200">

Yes. <u>Some of the latest core deliverables</u> implemented for ACAP in its [2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) version [**introduced security considerations**](/changelog#acap-2-security-debts) not present in the initial ([1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10)) version, which followed a more rigid [security model](/security) that adhered to best practices in web development security. The security changes in **version 2.0** resulted in a **measured reduction in coverage compared to version 1.0, <u>based on established criteria.</u>** (see table below)

<Callout type="warning">
_The development strategy for [**ACAP 2.0 - 2.1**](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) prioritized <i>rapid feature delivery</i>. To achieve this, it <u><i>adopted a more flexible Firestore database management setup that [altered security rules](/security/#firestore-database-rules)</i></u>. While these adjustments streamlined workflows, they also <i><b>introduced new security considerations that require further refinements</b></i> to align with [best practices](/security)._

_These known issues, including potential <u>XSS vulnerabilities</u> and the need for <u>stricter data validation</u>, are being tracked and are slated for future refinement. For a detailed technical breakdown and status, please see [**Issue #57**](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57) in the (private) [**acap-v2**](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2) parent repository._
</Callout>

##### ACAP Security Criteria

This table shows the overall security criteria ensured and accounted for by ACAP's best practices in its recommended [security guidelines](/security).

<Callout type="error">
The reduced enforcement of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection** particularly affects the <u>WYSIWYG-form Crop Recommendations</u>, leading to a reproducible security vulnerability. A [detailed description](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/34) is available in the parent **acap-v2** GitHub issues list, with a video demonstration available upon request.
</Callout>

| Criteria | Purpose | ACAP [1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10) | ACAP [2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| User authentication | Authorized, allowed, and predictable operations access to resources | â | â |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection** | <u>Predictable billing</u>, reliable/authentic website information, <u>user information confidentiality</u>, predictable data manipulation / SMS sending, protection for <u>unvalidated writes that allow tampering with stored data</u>, impacting system reliability, protection for <u>injecting malicious scripts</u> that <u>steal user info</u> or <u>redirect users to phishing sites</u> (and protection for other uncontrolled scenarios that stem from XSS) | â | â |
| Cloud storage protection | Authorized, allowed, and predictable operations access to storage, <u>predictable billing</u> | â | â |
| Database integrity | Accuracy, consistency, and <u>reliability</u> of data stored in a database and presented to users | â | â |
| Database protection | Authorized, allowed, and predictable operations access to the (Firestore) database, <u>predictable billing</u> | â | â |

Ensuring **system integrity** and **strong security measures** is critical when handling:

1. Sensitive user information (e.g., full name and contact numbers)
2. Paid subscription to external services (e.g., Firebase, Semaphore)
3. Reliable and predictable information output and system performance

##### Why Security Matters Before Upgrading Firebase

Activating a paid Firebase subscription unlocks advanced features, but security considerations must be addressed first. Unresolved security flaws introduced in the latest core deliverables for [ACAP 2.0+](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) could lead to <u>data breaches</u>, <u>unauthorized changes</u>, and <u>increased costs</u>.

<Callout type="error" emoji="">
ð«

Before activating a paid Firebase subscription, consider whether unresolved [ACAP Security Technical Debts](/changelog#acap-2-security-debts) exist. **[ACAP 2.0+](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) introduces known security flaws** that may impact user confidentiality, system integrity, and reliability.

#### Key issues include:

1. **Lenient Firestore security rules** â Direct **writes via Firestore REST APIs** bypass front-end controls, potentially allowing unauthorized data entry.
   ```text copy
   Temporary Mitigation: Restrict writes using Firestore security rules.
   Permanent Mitigation: Permanently restrict writes using
      Firestore security rules and perform database WRITE operations
      from the Node backend coupled with data validation.
   ```
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability** â **WYSIWYG crop recommendations** (only when "editing" recommendations) allow unvalidated HTML input, which may lead to stored XSS attacks (malicious scripts that persist in the database and execute when viewed).
   ```text copy
   Temporary Mitigation: Implement input sanitization before storage.
   Permanent Mitigation: Permanently restrict writes using
      Firestore security rules and perform database WRITE operations
      from the Node backend coupled with more
      robust/predictable data sanitization.
   ```
3. **Firestore database pollution** â Insufficient validation in **"Support Services"** data allows disorganized writes, which could:
   - Lead to excessive Firebase usage.
   - Create unexpected document structures, affecting query performance.
   ```
   Temporary Mitigation: Validate schema before database writes.
   ```

For more details, see [ACAP Security Technical Debts](/changelog/#acap-2-security-debts).

The [ACAP 2.0 codebase](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2) contains known security vulnerabilities, including lenient Firestore rules and a potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Activating a paid Firebase subscription before these issues are resolved could lead to data breaches and unexpected costs. Please review the **mitigation plan** in [**Issue #57**](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57) before proceeding.

#### Next Steps for Developers Before Activating Paid Plans:

- **Consult the <u>new ACAP Maintainer/Lead programmer</u>** who led the **ACAP 2.0 <u>major</u> features development** for current mitigation strategies and planned fixes of the security concerns introduced in ACAP 2.0.
   > Please review their **security mitigation plan** in [**Issue #57 - 2024 ACAP Updates Summary**](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57) (private GitHub repository - access available upon request) before proceeding.
   > Key topics to discuss include:
   >   - How security concerns, GitHub Issues [[#34]](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/34)[[#57]](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57) introduced in ACAP 2.0+ (available at the private parent [**acap-v2**](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57) GitHub Repository) are being addressed, including ongoing items.
   >   - Plans for improving security and risk mitigation before enabling Firebase
- **Review the Firestore security rules** to restrict direct database writes.
- **Check for XSS vulnerabilities** in crop recommendations and apply sanitization.
- **Monitor database writes** for unstructured or excessive storage.
- ð **Be mindful of ACAP's [Security Guidelines](/security) and [Security Best Practices](http://localhost:3000/articles/security-bestpractices/)** when <u>developing new features</u>.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
ACAP's [Security measures and practices for Firebase](/security) only cover the Firebase components that it actively uses: **Firestore Database**, **Firebase Storage**, **Authentication**, and **Hosting**.

Developers are encouraged to learn more about responsible Security measures and practices for other Firebase components or services, should they feel the need to <u>use</u> and <u>activate</u> [other Firebase services](https://firebase.google.com/products-build) (e.g., **Firebase ML**, **Cloud Functions**, **Extensions**, etc) for their ACAPs other than **four (4) main Firebase components** used by ACAP.
