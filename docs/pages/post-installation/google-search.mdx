# SEO with Google Search Console

[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO), helping websites become discoverable in search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo Search, along with other factors and best practices for achieving good SEO performance.

> _**Note** however, that Google Search Console alone won't drive up a website's SEO ranking. Visibility and popularity in search engines also depends on other SEO best practices, such as writing semantic, meaningful content on each page and building external links from external sources like social media, among others._

   ```

   <Callout>
   Note that the URL ends with a forward slash `/` as defined in the **sitemap.txt** file.<br />
   <b>`https://acap-bicol.github.io/weather-services/`</b> and not <br />

## Debug and Observe Errors

While waiting, observe and resolve errors that the Google Search Console may display in the dashboard - **Pages** tab.

<Steps>

### Resolve Errors

Navigate to the **Pages** tab and observe page indexing error logs that may appear under the **Pages** → **Why pages aren't indexed** section. Error logs may look like the screenshot:

![seo-error-logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acaptutorials/acaptutorials.github.io/assets/images/google_search_console_error_logs.png)

Inspect and resolve each error log.



### Confirm Indexed Pages

After a few days up to several weeks after a successful page indexing, view and confirm the list of indexed pages in the Google Search Console's **Pages** → **View data about indexed pages** page.

Search for your website in Google Search and observe if it will be among the top search results.
