# SEO with Google Search Console

[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO), helping websites become discoverable in search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo Search, along with other factors and best practices for achieving good SEO performance.

> _**Note** however, that Google Search Console alone won't drive up a website's SEO ranking. Visibility and popularity in search engines also depends on other SEO best practices, such as writing semantic, meaningful content on each page and building external links from external sources like social media, among others._
