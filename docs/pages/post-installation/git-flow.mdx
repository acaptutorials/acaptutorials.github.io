# Git Flow

This page **summarizes the simplified version of Git Flow** branching strategy from the [ACAP video tutorials](https://youtu.be/cV-9KszXEyw?feature=shared&t=845) when developing new features, bug fixes or tasks.

CI/CD using GitHub Actions deploy code updates to the **development** or **production** environments on certain triggers (eg., merging PRs to the dev branch or creating new Releases).

**(Optional)** Before proceeding, create a GitHub Issue describing the new feature, bug fix or task that you'll develop. This tracks and organizes the details of the incoming updates.

<Steps>

### Create a feature branch

- Create a **feature branch** branching out from the **dev branch**

   > If a GitHub Issue describes this feature, name the branch with the GitHub Issue number eg., `feat/acaptutorials-12` (Issue #12)

   ```sh
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feat/acaptutorials-12

   # Using other branch names
   # git checkout -b awesome-update
   ```

- This isolates new work (feature, bug fix, or task) so it doesn't destabilize the shared development branch.

### Merge the feature branch back to dev

- Once the feature is complete and reviewed via a **Pull Request (PR)**, it's merged back into **dev**.
- Approving a PR to the dev branch (or pushing updates directly to the dev branch) triggers a deployment to the **development** (Firebase Hosting, Render and, [Vercel](/articles/deployment-vercel) (if available)) environment.
- It allows testing the feature with other in-progress features in an integrated (development) environment.
- Delete the feature branch afterward to keep the repository clean.

### Promote dev to master

- When the **dev branch** has accumulated stable, tested features, create a Pull Request (PR) to **master**
- The master branch always reflects the code that's safe to release to production.

### Tag a release

- Tag and version a release from the **master branch** (e.g., v1.0.0).
- This creates an immutable snapshot of the code that corresponds to a specific release.
- It also triggers a deployment to the **production** (GitHub Pages, Render and, [Vercel](/articles/deployment-vercel) (if available)) environment.

</Steps>
