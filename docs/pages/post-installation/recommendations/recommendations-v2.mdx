# ACAP 2.0 Crop Recommendations

## Introduction

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This section describes methods for uploading the **ACAP 2.0** recommendations dataset, whose latest stable version is Release/Tag version <a href={process.env.RELEASE_PAGE ?? "#"} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>{process.env.RELEASE_VERSION}</b></a>, accessible in the **acap-v2** repository.

Follow this [link](/post-installation/recommendations/recommendations-v1) to view upload instructions for the older **ACAP 1.0** recommendations dataset.
</Callout>

## Data Format

<Callout type="warning">
The latest updates for **ACAP 2.1**, starting with @commit **95a97cd** in the **acap-v2 dev** branch, use a new Crop Recommendations Excel template different from the ones mentioned on this page.

> These Crop Recommendations are only compatible up to @commit **ee49568** in the **acap-v2 dev** branch.

Kindly chat the ACAP group chat for more information about the new Crop Recommendations Excel file for ACAP 2.1.
</Callout>

ACAP 2.0 uses recommendations data similar to the ACAP 1.0 raw data, added with climate risk information and exclusion of several Excel columns. View its raw EXCEL data files in the `/server/src/scripts/data/dataset_v2.0` directory to gain insight into its new contents and data structure.

The samples only display the ACAP 2.0 recommendations dataset for the Rice and Corn crops.

The **crop stage labels** should match the **crop stage codes** defined in the [ACAP 2.0 cropping calendar](/post-installation/cropping-calendar/calendar-v2#crop-stage-codes-and-labels) Excel files specific to target crops to ensure the correct association of crop stages with target recommendations.

**Support for Multiple Crops** <br />
Developers can add crop stages and labels for other crops, following the crop stages code and label format in the `/client/src/utils/constants.js` file and by creating recommendations datasets for other crops similar to the sample recommendations Excel files described in the [Data Format](#data-format) section as a reference.
</Callout>

## Upload Recommendations

**ACAP 2.0** uploads its recommendations dataset using an upload form on the **Manage Recommendations** page, requiring Admin login.

**Overwrite** and **commit** the sample cropping calendar Excel template files `rice_recommendations_v4.xlsx` and `corn_recommendations_v3.xlsx` in the **server** directory with the **regional recommendation files** to change the default sample Excel templates during live deployment.

Also, change the values of the environment variables (`RECOMMENDATIONS_RICE_EXCEL_FILE`, `RECOMMENDATIONS_CORN_EXCEL_FILE`) associated with its file names in the **client** `.env` file and **GitHub Secrets** if there is a need to use different file names or add new templates.

> **NOTE:** This step is only compatible until @commit **ee49568** (pre-ACAP 2.1) in the **acap-v2 dev** branch. Kindly chat the ACAP group chat for more information about the new Crop Recommendations Excel file format and management for ACAP 2.1 if it's missing in the online documentation.
