# Web Map on Home Page

This section covers how to update the GeoJSON map boundaries on the Home Page (the colored province overlays).

This step is labelled (Optional) because the SHAPEFILE and new AMIA Villages data for the target region may yet not be readily available during [Installation](/installation).

### Required Files

These steps require the files:

1. SHAPEFILE (.shp, .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg files) of the new region
2. New AMIA Villages information of the new region in a CSV file, following the format in the
`/server/src/scripts/data/amia_villages_r5.csv` file.

  <FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="data" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="amia_villages_r5.csv" />
            <FileTree.Folder name="geojson" defaultOpen>
              <FileTree.File name="acap-bicol.geojson" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree>

<Callout>
Since ACAP uses the provinces and municipality naming conventions from the PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel file, please ensure the **SHAPEFILE** and **AMIA Villages CSV file** share similar naming conventions with it.
</Callout>

### Normalize the SHAPEFILE

1. Convert the SHAPEFILE to a normalized, web-friendly GeoJSON file format. (Recommended GeoJSON file size is approximately less than 500KB).

2. (Optional) Use QGIS to check the SHAPEFILE for errors. Follow steps No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 described in the URL link to check and fix SHAPEFILE errors.
   https://github.com/ciatph/ciatph.github.io/issues/33#issuecomment-769405843

3. (Optional) Use the https://github.com/ciatph/shapefile-simplify tool to normalize, simplify and convert the SHAPEFILE to GeoJSON, playing around with PERCENTAGE % values that lead to a small file size with acceptable visual effects when loaded on the Home page.

   ACAP 1.0's GeoJSON file is available in `/server/src/scripts/data/geojson/acap-bicol.geojson` file for reference.

### Upload the GeoJSON file

#### MapBox Hosting

Upload the normalized GeoJSON file to MapBox, or any hosting service that allows serving GeoJSON content over HTTP from **Normalize the SHAPEFILE** step **#2** or **#3**. The original ACAP 1.0 uses MapBox (Datasets) for hosting.

Update the following variables when using MapBox:

```
MAPBOX_BASEMAP_STYLE_ID
MAPBOX_DATASET_ID
MAPBOX_API_KEY
```

#### Firebase Storage Hosting

You can use Firebase Storage in case a new MapBox account is not readily available.

Replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOJSON_URL` variable with the GeoJSON file's remote URL after uploading it to Firebase Storage.

### Upload the AMIA Villages Data

1. Upload the new AMIA Villages information (CSV file) to Firestore.
2. Copy the new CSV file to `/server/src/scripts/data/amia_villages_r5.csv`
3. Run the server NPM script:
   ```bash copy
   npm run seed:01_amiavillages
   ```
