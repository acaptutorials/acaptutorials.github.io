# ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs

The **ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs**, aiming to share ACAP's internal PAGASA weather forecast data in a structured, organized format and secure manner to collaborators, are a new addition to ACAP's REST APIs.

These APIs, accessible in the `/api/weatherforecast` and `/api/weatherforecast/archives` REST API endpoints, provide several GET query methods for retrieving seasonal, 10-day, and severe cyclone weather forecasts. Furthermore, its inclusion in ACAP allowed the archiving of historical weather forecast data, also available by query in these API endpoints.

These APIs are in their prototype stage, currently for use only by the Bicol region for sharing weather forecast data with IRRI as part of their collaboration project. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**Regions** outside Bicol _are to **prevent** these APIs and their respective archiving and deletion functions from running and being accessible until further notice by the DA. They can also start testing using it earlier_.

To prevent the **ACAP-RCMAS REST API** and functions from running, please supply the **"disabled"** values of its server `.env` file, GitHub Actions Secrets/Variables, and Render Secrets/Variables described in the **acap-v2**'s root and server README files.
