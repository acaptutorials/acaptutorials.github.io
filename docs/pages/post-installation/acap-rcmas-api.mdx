# ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs

The **ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs**, aiming to share ACAP's internal PAGASA weather forecast data in a structured, organized format and secure manner to collaborators, are a new addition to ACAP's REST APIs. Merging its feature updates from the forked development repository and environment into the official ACAP Bicol aims to:

- Unify **datadata sources** and **processes**, merging specific updates from the ACAP Bicol's **mirror environment** to the **official** ACAP Bicol environment.
- Make the APIs readily available for other regions should the DA request its activation and availability.

These APIs, accessible in the `/api/weatherforecast` and `/api/weatherforecast/archives` REST API endpoints, provide GET query methods for retrieving seasonal, 10-day, and severe cyclone weather forecasts. Furthermore, its inclusion in ACAP allowed the archiving of historical weather forecast data, also available by query in these API endpoints.

These APIs are in their prototype stage, currently for use only by the **Bicol** region for sharing structured and organized weather forecast data with IRRI as part of their collaboration project.

> Activation of the ACAP-RCMAS APIs is made into an optional feature for ACAP 2.0 that can be triggered by supplying certain backend environment variables and GitHub Secrets/Variables to ensure smooth integration with the standardized ACAP 1.0 deployments for other regions, which does not yet require these APIs.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**Regions** outside Bicol _are encouraged to **prevent** these APIs and their respective archiving and deletion functions from running and being accessible until further notice by the DA since **ACAP (for other regions) does not yet endorse activating the ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs.**_

Other regions can also start activating and using it earlier.

<Callout>
To prevent the **ACAP-RCMAS REST API** and functions from running, please supply the **"disabled"** values of its server `.env` file, GitHub Actions Secrets/Variables, and Render Secrets/Variables described in the **acap-v2**'s root and server README files.
