# PAGASA Special (Severe Cyclone) Weather Forecast

## Introduction

ACAP displays tropical cyclone data sourced from PAGASA's **Tropical Cyclone Bulletin** web page at https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical-cyclone/severe-weather-bulletin.

<Callout>
It regularly syncs with data from the PAGASA web page using a cron job that runs every two (2) hours in a GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflow, following a successful initialization and deployment setup.

## Manual Update

These steps describe running the cron script to trigger a manual update to ACAP's Special (Severe Cyclone) Weather Forecast data.

<Steps>

### Use a target environment

Open the server `.env` file. Update the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACC` and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` keys with the **development** or **production** key values.

### Run the NPM Script

1. Navigate to the `/server` directory from a terminal.

2. Run the command:
   ```bash copy
   npm run cron:cyclone
   ```

### Re-run on GitHub Actions

This method is an alternate option for running the NPM script aside fromÂ **step #2**, available after confirming a successful setup and deployment of the GitHub Actions cron jobs.

1. Go to the forked repository's **Actions** tab.
2. Select the **CRON Scrape and Update Cyclone Information** workflow in the left-side menu.
3. Select and click one of the latest successful workflow runs.
4. Press the button on the upper right with the label **"Re-run all jobs."**

</Steps>

## Recommendations

Since the special weather forecast updater runs in an NPM script, options are available for running it in OS-native cron or task schedulers as an alternative to using GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflow.
