## Introduction

ACAP sources its 10-day weather forecast data from PAGASA's public 10-day weather forecast data (available as Excel files from day 1 - day 10) their **10 Day Climate Forecast** web page at https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast.

This section describes updating the initial 10-day weather forecast data with the latest values.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
ACAP's initialization steps from the [Installation and Setup](/installation) section use an older set of 10-day weather forecast data for demonstration.
</Callout>

After confirming successful initialization and deployment setup, ACAP's cron script, running in a GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflow, will regularly sync with the latest posted PAGASA 10-data weather forecast daily once between 9:30 AM - 12:00 PM.

## Update Steps

<Steps>

### Use a target environment

Open the server `.env` file. Update the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACC` and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` keys with the **development** or **production** key values.

### Run the NPM Script

1. Navigate to the `/server` directory from a terminal.

2. Run the command:
   ```bash copy
   npm run cron:tenday
   ```

### Re-run on GitHub Actions

This method is an alternate option for running the NPM script aside from **step #2**, available after confirming a successful setup and deployment of the GitHub Actions cron jobs.

1. Go to the forked repository's **Actions** tab.
2. Select the **CRON Download, Parse and Upload Excel Files** workflow in the left-side menu.
3. Select and click one of the latest successful workflow runs.
4. Press the button on the upper right with the label **"Re-run all jobs."**

### Manual Data Upload

1. Sign in as an Admin to the ACAP website.
2. Go to the **ACAP Settings** → **10-DAY** tab.
3. Follow the instructions for manually updating the 10-day weather forecast data. It involves:
   - Download the day 1 - day 10 PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel files from PASAGA's [10-Day Climate Forecast](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast) web page to the local PC or laptop.
   - Upload all ten (10) of the Excel files using the **ACAP Settings** → **10-DAY** upload form.
4. Press the SUBMIT button after selecting the Excel files from **step #3**.
5. Wait for the update success or fail status response to appear. A successful trigger will display an updated "Date synced" field in the Current Data Update Summary section, displaying the latest time and date of the successful update.

</Steps>

## ACAP REST API

Seasonal weather forecast data is available in the REST API endpoints (plus other query parameters) if the [ACAP-RCMAS REST APIs](/post-installation/acap-rcmas-api) are active:

- **Current data:** `GET /api/weatherforecast?type=tenday`
- **Historical data:** `GET /api/weatherforecast/archives?type=tenday`

## Recommendations

Since the 10-day weather forecast updater runs in an NPM script, options are available for running it in OS-native cron or task schedulers as an alternative to using GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflow.
