ACAP's bulletin PDFs use hard-coded Bicol-related text in their headers and footers to allow flexible manual layout adjustments. These static elements should be updated with text relevant to the new region.

<Callout>
This section covers how to update the **static text content** within the PDF bulletin layouts. To **edit** or **create new** PDF layouts, refer to the [PDF Development](/articles/pdf-development) layout guide.
