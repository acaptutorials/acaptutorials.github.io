# Security Guidelines

ACAP adheres to strict security practices as defined by its technology stack, starting from its initial 1.0 version. When extending ACAP to add or enhance features, please ensure continued compliance with these security standards.

<Callout type="error" emoji="☠️">
**NOTE:** Further enhancements and feature updates to the initial **ACAP 1.0** version may introduce new requirements to address additional use cases. Please ensure that security measures meet the expectations outlined in these new requirements.
</Callout>

## Database

1. Manually test and ensure using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) and [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api) that:
   - (a) Signed-in users cannot perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations in the Firestore collections and documents defined in the Firestore Rules.
      <Callout type="warning">
      NOTE: If there is a need to perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations _**"directly"**_ in the Firestore collections or documents using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) or [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api), please ensure the creation and testing of robust, new [Firestore Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) that will meet the "new" requirements (ACAP <span className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">1.0</span> only performs such operations thru the backend NodeJS REST APIs, **Database #2**, **Database #3**). This ensures manageable security and safety, preventing security breaches like the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack example detailed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UZ6_OCTaY).
      </Callout>
   - (b) Signed-in users cannot **CREATE** new Firestore collections and documents
   - (c) Public users without sign-in authentication cannot **VIEW** sensitive information such as phonebook contacts and email information

2. Ensure that all mutative **"WRITE"** operations in the Firestore database occur only through authenticated HTTPS requests in the backend (NodeJS) REST APIs.
   - (a) ACAP 1.0's Firestore Rules strictly prohibits **Database #1.a** and **Database #1.b** to enforce this.
   - (b) If new requirements allow item **Database #1.a** to "directly" perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations in Firestore collections or documents using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) or [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api), please ensure that _**"new"**_ and robust [Firestore Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) are created and thoroughly tested. These Rules may need to be separate from ACAP <span className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">1.0</span>, which _"discourages this approach unless Firestore Rules can be properly enforced"_.

3. Ensure proper server-side validation when mutating data thru the backend (NodeJS) REST APIs.

4. Firestore database security relies on properly tested Firestore Rules to ensure security, especially if its rules do not disable all **VIEW/CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations.
   - Please ensure that "new" and robust Firestore Rules are created and thoroughly tested, in case new database components or requirements need to be added to the ACAP 1.0 Firestore database.

## Sensitive data management

1.  Ensure that sensitive data and environment variables are never statically generated and deployed to the GitHub Pages or Firebase Hosting static hosting websites.

2. Sensitive data, secured with Firebase Authentication, Firebase Custom Claims (**User/Admin Accounts #1, #2**) and Firestore Rules (**Database #1.c**) is dynamically fetched from the Firestore Database using the Firestore Web APIs or the secure (NodeJS) REST APIs.

## File Storage

Manually test and ensure, using the Firebase Storage Web APIs, that:

1. Public and signed-in users can only "READ" or download the PDF bulletin files.
2. Public and signed-in users cannot UPLOAD or DELETE files.

## Code base

Ensure that the forked climate-services-webportal-v1 (ACAP 1.0) or acap-v2 (ACAP 2.0) monorepo code base remains PRIVATE in GitHub.

## User/Admin Accounts

1. Ensure that Admin accounts are created by the superadmin in the NodeJS backend using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) with [Firebase Custom Claims](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims), leveraging the [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) to ensure maximum security.
