# Security Guidelines

ACAP adheres to strict security practices and development patterns defined by its technology stack <u>"_while considering compatible options with its limited (default) upgradable standard-pricing cloud services_"</u> starting from its initial [1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10) version.

Please ensure continued compliance with these security standards when extending ACAP to add or enhance new features while actively considering its currently available plans, options, and **feature requirements** at hand.

<Callout type="error" emoji="☠️">
**NOTE:** Further enhancements and feature updates to the initial [**ACAP 1.0**](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10) version may introduce new requirements to address additional use cases. Please ensure that security measures meet the expectations outlined in these new requirements.
</Callout>

## Database

1. Manually test and ensure using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) and [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api) that:
   - (a) Signed-in users cannot perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations in the Firestore collections and documents defined in the Firestore Rules.
      <Callout type="warning">
      NOTE: If there is a need to perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations _**"directly"**_ in the Firestore collections or documents using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) or [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api), please ensure the creation and testing of robust, new [Firestore Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) that will meet the "new" requirements (ACAP <span className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">1.0</span> only performs such operations thru the [backend NodeJS REST APIs](/directories/server), **Database #2**, **Database #3**). This ensures manageable security and safety, preventing security breaches like the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack example detailed at:<br /><br />

      >
         A YouTube video detailing steps for exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in the **ACAP 2.0 Crop Recommendations** at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UZ6_OCTaY has been set to private permissions to limit exposure. This video is a resource for understanding the security challenges associated with these vulnerabilities and ACAP, which occurred starting on **[ACAP 2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20)** due to new development approaches and priorities.

         For ACAP Maintainers or developers interested in exploring the content, please contact the current active ACAP Maintainer(s) for an invitation to access the video. Engaging with this material can provide insights into the security considerations that have been acknowledged and inform future enhancements to the system's security measures.
      </AnchorModal>
      </Callout>
   - (b) Signed-in users cannot **CREATE** new Firestore collections and documents
   - (c) Public users without sign-in authentication cannot **VIEW** sensitive information such as phonebook contacts and email information, by ensuring their Firestore collections are using the correct role/access-based Firestore Security Rules.

2. Ensure that all mutative **"WRITE"** operations in the Firestore database occur only through authenticated HTTPS requests in the backend (NodeJS) REST APIs. _(see also [Server](/directories/server) for more information)._
   - (a) ACAP 1.0's Firestore Rules strictly prohibits **Database #1.a** and **Database #1.b** to enforce this.
   - (b) If new requirements allow item **Database #1.a** to "directly" perform **CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations in Firestore collections or documents using the [Firestore Web API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) or [Firestore REST APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api), please ensure that _**"new"**_ and robust [Firestore Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) are created and thoroughly tested. These Rules may need to be separate from ACAP <span className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">1.0</span>, which _"discourages this approach unless Firestore Rules can be properly enforced"_.

3. Ensure proper server-side validation when mutating data through the backend (NodeJS) REST APIs using **validation scripts** in [_middleware_](/directories/server/#middleware) or the [_controller_](/directories/server/#controllers) scripts.

4. Firestore database security relies on properly tested Firestore Rules to ensure security, especially if its rules do not disable all **VIEW/CREATE/EDIT/DELETE** operations.
   - Please ensure that "new" and robust Firestore Rules are created and thoroughly tested, in case new database components or requirements need to be added to the ACAP 1.0 Firestore database.

### Firestore Database Rules

ACAP's [Firestore Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started), which enforces strict role/access-based security to the Firestore database, should be copied to the Firebase project's <b>Firestore Rules tab</b> in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/?pli=1). It is located in this file for reference:

```text copy
/client/src/firestore.rules
```

<Callout type="warning">
[ACAP 2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) allowed users to <u>edit crop recommendations, a new feature</u> introduced in **version 2.0** through <u>weak Firestore Security Rules</u>, making it vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. This lets **unauthorized clients** (e.g., Postman) <u><i>modify WYSIWYG-form data without protection</i></u> if accessed from the [Firestore REST APIs](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/). Allowing these in the Firestore Security Rules contradicts the best practices outlined in the [Database](#database) section, which advocates for data mutation with thorough <u>data validation</u> in the **Node backend**.

For more details, refer to GitHub Issues in the parent **acap-v2 repository** ([[1]](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/34), [[2]](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/issues/57)) or check the **Firebase Storage Announcements 2024** under the [Are there security concerns I should be aware of?](/announcements/firebase-storage-2024#security-considerations) section for information and reference.
</Callout>

## Sensitive data management

1.  Ensure sensitive data and environment variables are never statically generated and deployed to the GitHub Pages or Firebase Hosting static hosting websites.

2. Sensitive data, secured with Firebase Authentication, Firebase Custom Claims (**User/Admin Accounts #1, #2**), and Firestore Rules (**Database #1.c**), is dynamically fetched from the Firestore Database using the Firestore Web APIs or the secure (NodeJS) REST APIs.

   <Callout>
   Ensure that Firestore collections containing sensitive data (e.g., `"/phonebook/{docId}"`) are using appropriate role/access-based access settings defined in the **Firestore Security Rules**. This comprises a combination of **Firebase Authentication** and **Firebase Custom Claims**.
   </Callout>

## File Storage

Manually test and ensure, using the Firebase Storage Web APIs, that:

1. Public and signed-in users can only "READ" or download the PDF bulletin files.
2. Public and signed-in users cannot UPLOAD or DELETE files.

### Firebase Storage Security Rules

ACAP's [Firebase Storage Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/) enforce strict security by allowing only authenticated requests in the NodeJS backend to upload (PDF) files to the Firebase Cloud Storage while allowing public data (PDF, images) to download from the frontend. It should be copied to the Firebase project's <b>Storage Rules tab</b> in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/?pli=1). It is located in this file for reference:

```text copy
/client/src/storage.rules
```

## Codebase

- Ensure that forked **climate-services-webportal-v1** ([ACAP 1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10)) or **acap-v2** ([ACAP 2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20)) monorepo code base or copies remain PRIVATE in GitHub and other public platforms.

## User/Admin Accounts

1. Ensure that Admin accounts are created by the superadmin in the NodeJS backend using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) with [Firebase Custom Claims](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims), leveraging the [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) to ensure maximum security.

2. More information about ACAP's Security requirements is available in its Software Requirements Specifications document in this [link](https://github.com/amia-cis/acap-v2/blob/dev/docs/acap_1.0_software_requirements_specification_v4.0.pdf) (accessible only for developers with access).

   <Callout type="info">
   These Security requirements carry over and apply to **ACAP 2.0**, even if the Software documents were written for **ACAP 1.0**. Since no new Software documents are available for the updates made in ACAP 2.0, you may <u>consult the new lead programmer</u> responsible for implementing ACAP 2.0 <u>about detailed upgrades specifics made to the system</u>.
   </Callout>

## Node Package Libraries (NPM)

ACAP, a web application built with Firebase, Express, React/Next.js, and Node.js, relies on open-source development libraries from the **Node Package Manager (NPM)** for its **client** and **server** applications.

Since ACAP's initial development in 2022, many of these libraries may have become outdated as newer versions are released.

Developers maintaining ACAP are encouraged to <u>monitor and update these dependencies as needed</u> to benefit from performance improvements, security patches, and new features, possibly requiring using <u>newer Node versions</u>.
