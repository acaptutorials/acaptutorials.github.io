# About ðŸ’¡

This site offers a more organized and structured approach to documenting the software development approaches for the **Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP)**, initially released as ACAP 1.0 (ACAP Bicol) at the end of 2022 and enhanced to version 2.0 in 2024.

- [ACAP 1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10) serves as the base model of the Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP). Initially made for the Bicol region, it provides dynamic features setup support for other regional provinces. It served as the active ACAP version until ACAP 2.0.
- [ACAP 2.0](/changelog/#version-2-acap-20) and beyond is an extension of the Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP), a Climate Information System, <u><i>expanding</i></u>, <u><i>enhancing</i></u>, and <u><i>building upon</i></u> the initial [ACAP 1.0](#version-1-acap-10) version.
   > ACAP 2.0 builds upon ACAP 1.0 rather than replacing it. It enhances and expands the original system while maintaining its core foundation.
