# Welcome to ACAP Tutorials

This site offers a more organized and structured approach to documenting the software development approaches for the Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal - Bicol (ACAP Bicol), initially released as ACAP 1.0 at the end of 2022 and now enhanced to version 2.0 as of 2024.

This documentation website is a revamped version of the previous documentation websites, offering new informative sections such as [Post-Installation](/post-installation), containing after-initial installation notes and checklists, more details on [Security](/security) guidelines, and other development-related details.
