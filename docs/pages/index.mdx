### Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP), a Climate Information System

This site offers a more organized and structured approach to documenting the software development approaches for the Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP), initially released as [ACAP 1.0](/changelog/#version-1-acap-10) (ACAP Bicol) at the end of 2022 and enhanced to version [2.0](https://acap-bicol.github.io/) in 2024.

> The Agro-Climatic Advisory Portal (ACAP), a Climate Information Services web application (CIS) co-developed by the [University of the Philippines Los Banos Foundation, Inc.](https://uplbfi.org/) (UPLBFI) and the [Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT (Alliance)](https://alliancebioversityciat.org/) with the [Department of Agriculture (DA)](https://www.da.gov.ph/) and the [Regional Field Office 5 (RFO 5)](https://bicol.da.gov.ph/) is a digital platform that serves as a centralized hub for the development of Climate Information Services (CIS) in the Bicol Region. It contains relevant weather and climate information to use with tailored advisories and crop recommendations.

This documentation website is a revamped version of the previous documentation websites, offering informative new sections such as [Post-Installation](/post-installation), containing after-initial installation notes and checklists, more details on [Security](/security) guidelines, and other development-related details.
