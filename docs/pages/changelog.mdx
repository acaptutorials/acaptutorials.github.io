# ACAP Change Log

This page contains summary of features and enhancements on major ACAP versions and their programming-development timelines.

<Steps>

### Version 2 (ACAP 2.0)

_June 2024 - ongoing_

Version 2.0 highlights ongoing improvements and newly added features, expanding and enhancing the initial [ACAP](#version-1-acap-10) version.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
ACAP 2.0 is the latest ACAP version. It's latest stable version is Release/Tag version <b><a href={process.env.RELEASE_PAGE}><u>{process.env.RELEASE_VERSION ?? '0.0.0'}</u></a></b>, dev branch <b>@{process.env.COMMIT_ID ?? '123456'}</b> accessible in the **acap-v2** code repository.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Version 2.0 and later versions may have new requirements that will thrive on new development approaches loosely tied to the recommended [Security](/security) and [Server](/directories/server) guidelines of **ACAP 1.0**, requiring thorough testing and validation.
</Callout>

<FAQBoxError title="💀 Version 2.0 - 2.1 Security Technical Debts:">
1. **Flexible Firestore Database Use:** Version 2.0+ adopted a more flexible approach for handling data management, facilitating faster feature development by performing WRITE operations to the database directly from the web front end coupled with more lenient Firestore database Rules. However, this shift also introduced the potential for data to enter the database without the usual front-end controls through the Firestore REST APIs. While this was not an issue in Version 1.0, it emerged as part of the effort to enhance development speed and feature delivery starting with Version 2.0.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Crop Recommendations:** Related to item 1, the new process for editing WYSIWYG HTML-form crop recommendations input may allow unsafe or inaccurate content due to limited validation. Risks associated with this were recognized early in the process, but the focus on delivering core features led to a delay in integrating security measures. Additionally, the smaller scope of the project contributed to a perception that it might not require the same level of thorough security measures typically expected in larger-scale projects.
3. **Crop recommendations data integrity:** Ensuring that data presentations in PDF bulletins remain unaltered, trustworthy, and accurate is crucial for users and future developers. This priority stems from the concerns identified in items 1 and 2.

> These issues, raised during the early 2.0 development phase, have been communicated to the new main ACAP Maintainer, who is also the primary developer leading the creation and enhancement of new features for Version 2.0. The new Maintainer has made thoughtful decisions for balancing development speed with feature delivery, reflecting their understanding of the project's scope and the perceived security needs. They are open to addressing these issues as time and priorities allow within the ACAP project timeline.

### Version 1 (ACAP 1.0)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
ACAP 1.0's last stable version is Release/Tag version [**v9.5.6**](https://github.com/amia-cis/climate-services-webportal-v1/releases/tag/v9.5.6), accessible in the **climate-services-webportal-v1** and **acap-v2** code repositories.
</Callout>

Version 1.0 marks the initial ACAP Bicol release used as a base model and template for subsequent developer training and sharing with other regions in the succeeding years starting on [**July 2023**](https://uplbfi.org/?p=2097).

Developed with a Security-first approach, ACAP 1.0 especially notes common Firestore security pitfalls and keeps a watchful eye on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks since it uses What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) HTML input for crop recommendations and PDF generation.

It has the following features, strictly following and is tested compatible with the recommended [Security](/security) and [Server](/directories/server) guidelines:
