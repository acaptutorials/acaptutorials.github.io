# ACAP Video Tutorials

## Introduction

This wiki discusses the development and cloud deployment approaches and strategies used with [ACAP 1.0 (ACAP-Bicol)](https://amia-cis.github.io/). This page aims to serve as a go-to reference for demonstrating technical methods in videos under the [Playlist](#playlist) section and to provide general guidelines and recommended approaches to interact with the ACAP 1.0 source codes.

<Callout>
These video tutorials for setting up ACAP were created with compatibility to the initial ACAP (ACAP 1.0, with the last stable version at Release/TagÂ **v9.5.6**) released in 2023 but should be more or less still compatible with the newer ACAP versions.

<Callout type="warning">
Newer ACAP versions with drastic new updates may no longer sync with these video tutorials.

### How to Proceed

1. Quickly view and skim thru the videos under the [Playlist](#playlist) section to get a quick grasp and summary of how ACAP-Bicol is initialized for local development to online (live) deployment.

2. Initialize ACAP for your target region for localhost development by going thru the [ACAP 1.0 Duplication for New Regions Running on Localhost (Development) Tutorial](https://acaptutorials.github.io/assets-cms/posts/post/?id=Teo2m6os7LZtsEi0nGWw).
   - At this point, you may want to refer to the online video tutorials for more detailed demonstration on several topics related for ACAP's localhost development:
      - [ ] [06 Initialize the Source Code Repository - Part 1/2](https://youtu.be/37bKOdfIaBY)
      - [ ] [07 Initialize Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Authentication)](https://youtu.be/gJESQaT0IBQ)
      - [ ] [08 **Server** setup for localhost development](https://youtu.be/yse71BamaoI) (Testing on Region 7)
      - [ ] [09 **Client** setup for localhost development](https://youtu.be/f3icH3jmnTo) (Testing on Region 7)
   - Run your client + server ACAP on localhost. Visit and check [Initial ACAP 1.0 Duplication Checklist](https://acaptutorials.github.io/assets-cms/posts/post/?id=83Nc7KofhEU91LJOOtQd) to see if your ACAP initialization fits with success several success metrics for localhost development

3. Online deployment is next after finishing and wrapping up running ACAP on localhost.
   - Online deployment is quite flexible and you may use new methods, techniques and services which you may be more familiar with.
   - You may also follow ACAP's methods for these areas, which are described and demonstrated in more detail in the tutorial videos:
