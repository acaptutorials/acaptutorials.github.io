## Introduction

Create ACAP admin accounts to use for testing. Developers signed in as ACAP superadmins may create other accounts later for Regional Field Officers (RFOs) by signing in to ACAP's **superadmin** dashboard. The following methods require a successfully running ACAP client + server app, carrying on from the [Integration](/installation/integration) section.
