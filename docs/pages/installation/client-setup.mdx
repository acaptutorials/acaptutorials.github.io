# C. Client Setup

Please read the client's README file in /client/README.md as reference for more information on the client environment variables.

<Steps>

### Setup environment variables

Update the **client** `.env` file, copying the keys and values from the `.env.example` file. You can leave the default values for now, but be sure to update the following with new values:

```env copy
REGION_NAME
DEFAULT_PROVINCE
DEFAULT_MUNICIPALITY // --> Any municipality under the DEFAULT_PROVINCE
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_AUTHDOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_WEB_MEASUREMENT_ID
REGION_CODE
REGION_LAT_AND_LNG
REGIONAL_FIELD_OFFICE
REGION_URL
CROPPING_CALENDAR_RICE_EXCEL_FILE
CROPPING_CALENDAR_CORN_EXCEL_FILE
RECOMMENDATIONS_RICE_EXCEL_FILE
RECOMMENDATIONS_CORN_EXCEL_FILE
```

### Copy template files

Create a directory named **"files"** under the /client/public directory: **"/client/public/files"**.

1. Copy the Excel files from the **"/server/src/scripts/data/dataset_v2.0"** directory to the **"files"** directory
2. Copy the the **/server/src/scripts/data/pagasa_seasonal_v2.xlsx** Excel file to the **"files"** directory
3. Use the **"files"** directory and its contents on localhost development but not push it to the repository.

### Update environment variables after deployment

Certain client environment variables, such as URLs (i.e., `BASE_URL_PROD`) will become available after deployment. Update the rest of the `.env` variables later after:

- Setting-up and deploying the (development and production) servers respectively to their own Render.com cloud services
- Deploying the development website to Firebase Hosting
- Deploying the production website to GitHub Pages

</Steps>
