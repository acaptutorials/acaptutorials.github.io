# Deployment to Vercel

ACAP Bicol started deploying its Node backend to Vercel along with the official Render deployment starting in its [2.0](/changelog#version-2-acap-20) version, aiming to achieve faster API response times than its (standard-pricing) Render-deployed APIs that experience 30 secs - 1 minute cold starts specifically for its [ACAP-RMCAS APIs](/post-installation/acap-rcmas-api).

<Callout>
**ACAP does not officially endorse deployment to Vercel** nor **activation of the ACAP-RMCAS APIs for <u>other regions</u>**. Therefore, no step-by-step video guides demonstrate its initialization and usage, unlike the supported Render <sup>[[1]](https://youtu.be/IyGmWzoFPZE)</sup> <sup>[[2]](https://youtu.be/_Ese9uCXizE)</sup> deployment.

The Vercel deployment and new API endpoints (also accessible in the official Render deployment, if activated) are only for the prototype development purposes of sharing <u>ACAP Bicol's</u> internal PAGASA-sourced weather forecast data with collaborators, which needed to start using **unified data sources** and **processes** from July 2024, with an option to be activated by other regions upon request by the DA.

All ACAP Node REST APIs (except for PDF bulletin creation) are supported in its **Vercel** deployment.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
While ACAP does not officially endorse and encourage deployment to Vercel, interested developers can also explore setting up and using its deployment for study purposes.
</Callout>

To ensure smooth integration with the existing ACAP 1.0 deployments other than ACAP Bicol, the <u>Vercel deployment</u> and <u>activation of the ACAP-RCMAS APIs</u> are made into **optional features** for ACAP 2.0 that can be triggered by supplying certain backend environment variables and GitHub Secrets/Variables.

The following steps describe how ACAP configures the Vercel CLI and GitHub Actions for building and deploying its NodeJS Express server app to Vercel for reference.

## Vercel Requirements

- Vercel account
   <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
   ACAP Bicol uses a standard-tier Vercel account pricing plan, which limits sharing its Vercel apps to only one (1) developer.
   </Callout>
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)
   - Installed locally
   - For reference, ACAP is using the v28.16.7 version.
   - ACAP uses the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#vercel-cli-overview) in GitHub Actions to deploy its Node backend to Vercel to avoid linking the code repository to Vercel. Using the Vercel CLI is one of the [three (3) supported methods](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel#7.-deploy-on-vercel) for deploying apps to Vercel.
- Node
   - Node v16.14.2 (or ACAP's latest declared Node version)

## Initialize Dependencies

Prepare the local PC or laptop for Vercel deployment.

1. Create a Vercel Access Token.
   - Login to Vercel.
   - Create a Vercel Access Token in **Profile Icon** -> **Account Settings** -> **Tokens** named `VERCEL_TOKEN`, selecting the `"No Expiration"` option.

2. Install Vercel CLI globally if it's not installed on the local development PC or laptop.
   - You can try installing the `@latest` CLI version and revert to v28.16.7 (used by ACAP) if the steps following the global installation fail.
   - Install the CLI version used by ACAP.
      ```bash copy
      npm i -g vercel@28.16.7
      ```

## Development App Initialization

<Callout>
These steps will initialize an ACAP server app for deployment to the **"DEVELOPMENT"** Vercel environment.

Repeat the following steps to initialize an ACAP server app for deployment to the **"PRODUCTION"** Vercel environment under the [Production App Initialization](#production-app-initialization) section.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Initialize the ACAP Development Vercel App

1. Login using the Vercel CLI
   ```bash copy
   vercel login
   ```

2. Navigate to the **acap-v2/server** directory using a terminal. Run the command to create a new Vercel project.
   ```bash copy
   vercel link
   ```

3. Answer the required prompts:
   - **Set up "path/to/acap-v2/server"? [Y/n]:** _Press Enter_
   - **Which scope should contain your project?** _Press Enter to select the default_
   - **Link to existing project? [y/N]:** _Press Enter (n)_
   - **What's your project's name?:** _Type any app name (e.g., "acap-dev") and press Enter_
   - **In which directory is your code located? ./:** _Press Enter to select the ./ default_
   - Other info prompts:
      ```
      Local settings detected in vercel.json:
      No framework detected. Default Project Settings:
      ...
      ```
   - **Want to modify these settings? [y/N] n**: *Press Enter (n)*

3. Take note of the `projectId` and `orgId` values from the `project.json` file inside the generated `.vercel` folder.

   <Callout type="info">
   Add these **"DEVELOPMENT"** Vercel values in the forked ACAPs' GitHub Secrets as:

   ```
   VERCEL_TOKEN=(Use the VERCEL_TOKEN value from step #1)
   VERCEL_ORG_ID=(value of orgId)
   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DEV=(value of projectId)
   VERCEL_APP_DEV=(name of the "DEVELOPMENT" Vercel app)
   ```
   </Callout>

4. Confirm the creation of an empty Vercel app with the **project name** from the prompt in the Vercel account's projects dashboard.

5. Go to **(Vercel Project)** -> **Settings** -> **Environment Variables**. Set the environment variables similar to the **"DEVELOPMENT"** Render Environment Variables.

   <Callout type="warning">
   Ensure similar environment variables and values in the **"DEVELOPMENT"** Render deployment with the **Vercel Environment** variables. Set the value:
   `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=vercel`
   </Callout>

7. Set the **development** Vercel app's Runtime to **Node 16.x**.
   - Go to the **(Vercel Project)** -> **Settings** -> **General** -> **Node.js Version** section.
   - Set the **Node.js Version** to `16.x`

   <Callout type="warning">
   The Vercel app's **Node.js Version** should be similar to its declared Node version in its server's `engines` section in the `/server/package.json` file. Vercel stops supporting old Node versions after some time, which may cause future deployments to fail.
   </Callout>


### Deploy Development Local App

1. Prepare the local ACAP server directory for Vercel deployment. Confirm that the **acap-v2/server** directory has the following files:
   - Create a `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary items from being deployed to Vercel.
      - Copy the contents of the `.gitignore` file into the `.vercelignore` file.
      - Include all other directories and files to omit in the Vercel deployment in the .vercelignore file.
   - Make sure that your target project directory has an **/api** directory that:
      - contains Vercel serverless function files following the Vercel "api" syntax
      - Or an `index.js` file (for standalone Express apps), minus the `app.listen()` part, with the app exported as `module.exports = app`
   - Create a `vercel.json` file in the **/acap-v2/server** directory. See the attached `vercel.json` file for reference.
      ```
      {
        "rewrites": [{
          "source": "/api/(.)",
          "destination": "/api"
        }],
        "redirects": [{
          "source": "/src(.)",
          "destination": "/index.html"
        }]
      }
      ```

2. Generate the API documentation for Vercel deployment.
   ```bash copy
   npm run gen:docs:vercel
   ```

3. Deploy the "DEVELOPMENT" Vercel app locally for the first time from a terminal, using the "raw" value of the `VERCEL_TOKEN` variable from step #1.
   ```
   vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   vercel build --prod --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   ```

</Steps>

## Production App Initialization

<Callout>
These steps will initialize an ACAP server app for deployment to the **"PRODUCTION"** Vercel environment.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Initialize the ACAP Production Vercel App

1. Delete the **acap-v2/server/.vercel** directory generated after completing the [ACAP Development App Initialization](#development-app-initialization) steps.

   <Callout type="warning">
   Delete this folder to avoid conflicts setting up the "PRODUCTION" Vercel app.
   </Callout>

2. Login using the Vercel CLI if not yet signed in.
   ```bash copy
   vercel login
   ```

3. Navigate to the **acap-v2/server** directory using a terminal. Run the `vercel link` command to create a new Vercel project - for the "PRODUCTION" environment.
   ```bash copy
   vercel link
   ```

4. Answer the required prompts, similar to the [ACAP Development App Initialization](#development-app-initialization). Provide a different project name when prompted with the question:
   - **What's your project's name?:** _Type a new app name (e.g., "acap-prod") and press Enter_

5. Take note of the **new** `projectId` and `orgId` values from the `project.json` file inside the newly generated **.vercel** folder.

   <Callout type="info">
   Add these **"PRODUCTION"** Vercel values in the forked ACAPs' GitHub Secrets as:

   ```
   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_PROD=(value of new projectId)
   VERCEL_APP_PROD=(name of the "PRODUCTION" Vercel app)
   ```
   </Callout>

6. Confirm the creation of an empty Vercel app with the "PRODUCTION" project name created by the prompt in the Vercel account's projects dashboard.

7. Go to the PRODUCTION" **(Vercel Project)** -> **Settings** -> **Environment Variables**. Set the environment variables similar to the "PRODUCTION" Render Environment Variables.

   <Callout>
    Ensure similar environment variables and values in the **"PRODUCTION"** Render deployment with the **Vercel Environment** variables. Set the value: `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=vercel`
   </Callout>

8. Set the **production** Vercel app's Runtime to Node **16.x**.

   <Callout type="warning">
   The Vercel app's **Node.js Version** should be similar to its declared Node version in its server's `engines` section in the `/server/package.json` file. Vercel stops supporting old Node versions after some time, which may cause future deployments to fail.
   </Callout>

### Deploy Production Local App

1. Generate the API documentation for Vercel deployment.
   ```bash copy
   npm run gen:docs:vercel
   ```

2. Deploy the "PRODUCTION" Vercel app locally for the first time from the terminal. Use the "raw" value of the `VERCEL_TOKEN` variable from step #1.
   ```
   vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   vercel build --prod --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=VERCEL_TOKEN
   ```

</Steps>

## GitHub Actions

1. Confirm the creation of the **GitHub Secrets**.
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel Access Token (from the [Initialize Dependencies](#initialize-dependencies) section, **step #1**)
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
      - Vercel Organization ID
      - Retrieved by answering the prompts from either the [Initialize the ACAP Development Vercel App](#initialize-the-acap-development-vercel-app) or [Initialize the ACAP Production Vercel App](#initialize-the-acap-development-vercel-app) steps
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DEV` - Development Vercel app project ID
   - `VERCEL_APP_DEV` - Development Vercel app project name
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_PROD` - Production Vercel app project ID
   - `VERCEL_APP_PROD` - Production Vercel app project name
   - `ROOT_API_URL_VERCEL_DEV` - Development Vercel app website URL
   - `ROOT_API_URL_VERCEL_PROD` - Production Vercel app website URL

2. Confirm the creation of the **GitHub Variable**.
   - `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM`
      - Value: `vercel`
      - Value: Set to `default` or do not include in the GitHub Variables to skip deployment to Vercel

3. Review the contents of the **.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml** and **.github/workflows/release.yml** files --> `deploy-server-vercel` job for more information about the GitHub Actions workflows for deployment to the "DEVELOPMENT" and "PRODUCTION" Vercel environments.

4. Trigger a deployment to ACAP's development and production environments using GitHub Actions. Observe failure/success logs for the overall deployments, including Vercel.

5. Delete the local **/server/.vercel** folder. Development or production deployments to Vercel should now trigger in GitHub Actions.
