# 🔐 ACAP Developer Security Best Practices Checklist

> This checklist, reflecting the needs of the [Security](/security) section and the [ACAP Professional Mindset on Security](https://github.com/acaptutorials/acaptutorials/blob/main/README.md#-acap-professional-mindset-on-security), enumerates the desirable traits and mindsets of programmers, especially for **code maintainers** or **main/primary ACAP lead developers** handling ACAP development.
>
> ✅ Use this checklist as a guideline along with the [Security](#security) expectations during planning, code reviews, or when designing features that handle user input, authentication, or database operations.

### 1. Mindset and Responsibility
- [ ] I prioritize **user safety and data protection** over rapid feature delivery.
- [ ] I integrate **security considerations in every development phase**—from design to deployment.
- [ ] I recognize that **security is a shared team responsibility**, not a post-incident task.

### 2. Firestore & Backend Practices
- [ ] I **avoid writing to Firestore directly from the front-end** when the data is sensitive or requires validation.
- [ ] I implement **strong Firestore security rules** that match the expected schema and use strict access controls.
- [ ] I **validate all input server-side**, even if it’s also validated on the front-end.

### 3. Input Handling and Content Security
- [ ] I sanitize **WYSIWYG or HTML-formatted input** to prevent XSS or unsafe content injection.
- [ ] I use **established libraries and sanitization methods** instead of building ad-hoc solutions for HTML or user input.
- [ ] I escape user-generated content correctly in all **PDFs, emails, and rendered UI components**.

### 4. Data Structure Integrity
- [ ] I enforce **tight schema validation** to prevent Firestore document pollution (uncontrolled key-value growth).
- [ ] I use **Firebase Cloud Functions or middle-layer APIs** to validate and shape incoming data before writing to the database.
- [ ] I regularly monitor for **unexpected document structures or recursive collections**.

### 5. Security Reports and Technical Debt
- [ ] I take **security concerns seriously**, especially those that are **clearly reproducible** or reported by team members.
- [ ] I **do not delay security fixes** unless justified with clear documentation and risk mitigation steps.
- [ ] I log and track known vulnerabilities as **actionable backlog items**, not as "someday" issues.

### 6. Team Collaboration and Growth
- [ ] I am **open to feedback** and security advice from peers, even if it challenges my current approach.
- [ ] I **communicate blockers** early if I need help on a security implementation.
- [ ] I actively **share security learnings** with the rest of the team (e.g., via code reviews or internal notes).
