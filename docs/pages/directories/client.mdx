# Client

The **client** directory contains codes and configurations/settings for the (React) NextJS v13 + Material UI v5 front end and Firebase. The folder tree displays the relevant files and folders.

The NextJS frontend uses the [**pages router**](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) since this is suitable for generating static pages to host on GitHub Pages. It uses the `"container component"` as a dominant pattern, also known as `"component and presentational"` components, for distinguishing between logic (container) and UI (component).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This documentation only contains information about relevant files and directories within the **client** directory. For more information about NextJS-specific files and configurations (such as the `next.config.js`, `_app.js`, or `document.js` files), please head over to the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) for **Pages Router**.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Developers should take care not to "bake" or "build" sensitive data and information into the frontend build during the NextJS static build time with `"next export"` as part of [Security - Sensitive Data Management](/security/#sensitive-data-management).
</Callout>

## Files

- **.env.example** - example keys and values to put in the `.env` file
- **.firebaserc** - Firebase configuration file
- **firebase.json** - Firebase configuration file
- **firestore.rules** - Firestore Rules definitions to publish in a Firebase project's Firestore Rules settings
- **storage.rules** - Firebase Storage Rules definitions to publish in a Firebase project's Storage settings
- **Dockerfile.acap** - multi-stage build Dockerfile definition for running the client on localhost development or as "built" static files for production deployment running on nginx.
- **package.json / package-lock.json** - Contains definitions of the client's NodeJS dependency libraries

## Folders

### /pages

- Components here serves as the "container" components in the container-component pattern, mostly component logic
- ex: "pages/admin", "pages/admin/reports",
"pages/bulletins", "pages/home"

### /components

- Components defined here serves as the "UI" counterpart of each "page" in the container components
- They can contain nested UI components
- ex: "components/admin", "components/admin/reports",
components/bulletins", "components/home"

### /components/common/ui

- Common UI used everywhere
- ex: loading spinners, modal, snackbar, skeleton loaders, fileuploader

### /components/layout

- UI for massive page-wide layouting

### /components/entities

- (main) UI with processing functions
- ex: login, searchbar, auth hoc

### /domain

- UI subcomponents of main UI/features stored in the /components or /pages directory

### /src/hooks

- Custom hooks used for main objects

### /src/services

- Firebase API calls for main objects
- ex: reports, bulletins, provinces, atbp

### /src/store

- Redux (toolkit) stores and slices
- Used for managing and tracking heavy-weight main objects data
- Convenient for passing data across deeply-nested React components
- ex: reports, recommendations, municipalities
